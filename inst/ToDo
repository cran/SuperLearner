# ToDo: #

* Add more controls for the cross validation in CV.SuperLearner
* Improve summary.CV.SuperLearner and summary.SuperLearner.
* Figure out a way to get verbose output when using mcSuperLearner and snowSuperLearner, maybe something like a progress bar. Currently the verbose option only work in the terminal, but not in the GUI.
* Build a test for each wrapper included in the package
