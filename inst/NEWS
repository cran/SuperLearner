---
Version: 2.0-29
Date: 2024-02-06
* Added n.cores argument to SL.gbm
* fixed formula warning in SL.loess. Note the loess() function is limited to 1-4 features

* removes SL.extraTrees (no longer on CRAN, available at SuperLearnerExtra)

---
Version: 2.0-28
Date: 2021-04-13
* Updated maintainer email
* SL.gam added back, but now importing gam to avoid CRAN NOTE on usage or require()

---
Version: 2.0-26
Date: 2019-08-12
* Added obsWeights and id arguments to the test-glmnet.R file, line 24

---
Version: 2.0-25
Date: 2019-08-05
* Updated listWrappers() to allow search results without SuperLearner loaded
* Fixed error in 'predict.SL.ksvm' and 'predict.SL.glmnet' when newdata is a single row (added drop = FALSE)
* Added control option to 'SuperLearner' to save the internal cross-validation algorithm fits as a list. default is FALSE.
* Removed dbarts from Suggests and the associated wrapper over to SuperLearnerExtra. dbarts no longer available on CRAN
* added prettydoc as a Depends for the vignette
* changed VignetteBuilder to rmarkdown
* Removed the SuperLearnerPresent.Rnw file, was a shortcut to create the SuperLearnerR vignette
* Changed .SL.require to use 'requireNamespace()' instead of 'require()'
* added '.SL.require("bibmemory")' to 'SL.biglasso.R'
* allowed SL.gam to use s() instead of gam::s() and 'require' instead of 'requireNamespace`

---
Version: 2.0-24
Date: 2018-07-10
* remove multicore test in randomForest test. Was generating warning note on CRAN devel

---
Version: 2.0-23
Date: 2018-03-09
* fixed transformation of outcome in SL.dbarts for binomial family
* SampleSplitSuperLearner(): support validation sample size of 1 when observation's row number is passed in via 'split'.
* Fixed case where single-column X in combination with more than one screening algorithm causes failure in SuperLearner(), snowSuperLearner(), mcSuperLearner(), SampleSplitSuperLearner().
* methods CC.* modified to handle duplicated columns better (PR #106)
* Updated S3 class name for gam::gam() to be Gam


---
Version: 2.0-22
Date: 2017-07-07
* Added model.matrix to SL.xgboost
* Fixed innerCvControl in CV.SuperLearner to allow multiple parameters. It must now be a list of lists.
* create.Learner(): support character arguments.
* Glmnet: support alternative loss functions; when predicting automatically add any missing covariates and remove covariates not in the original data.
* Added SL.kernelKnn
* Added SL.ksvm
* Added SL.ranger
* Added vignette: "Guide to SuperLearner"
* Added SL.biglasso
* Added SL.lm, SL.speedlm, and SL.speedglm
* Added SL.lda and SL.qda
* Added SL.dbarts for C++-based bayesian additive regression trees.
* SL.lm and SL.glm now have a model argument, defaulting to TRUE (matching glm and lm), but can be changed to FALSE to conserve memory. Both wrappers also explicitly convert X matrix to a data frame.
* Added SL.extraTrees for extremely randomized trees, a random forest variant.
* Fixes prediction when a learner fails for methods: NNLS, NNloglik, CC_nloglik, and AUC. NNLS2 and CC_LS still have this bug. This fix required that an additional optional argument "errorsInLibrary" be passed to methods. This argument is a vector set to TRUE for learners that failed during model fitting.


---
Version: 2.0-21
Date: 2016-10-03
* Add validRows option for CV.SuperLearner. Can now pass a cvControl for the outer CV and a list of cvControls, one for each cross-validation folds SuperLearner calls. default number of folds in CV.SuperLearner is now 10, matching the default with cvControl. If the user specifies both V and number of folds in cvControl(), an error message is returned.

---
Version: 2.0-20
Date: 2016-08-09
* Added shrinkage parameter to SL.gbm
* fixed mtry default in SL.randomForest
* in CV.SuperLearner, fixed order for checking parallel options and folds argument in parLapply (thanks Chris Kennedy)
* updated method.AUC to change defaults on the optimization and add warnings for non-convergence
* Added wrapper for xgboost (thanks Chris Kennedy)
* Added wrapper for bartMachine (thanks Chris Kennedy)
* Added travis.ci checks
* Added environments for SuperLearner() and CV.SuperLearner() wrappers search path (includes SL.*, screen.*, and method.* wrappers)
* Added binary outcomes for SL.cforest

* moved quadprog from depends to suggests as it is only called if the user uses method = "method.NNLS2" not the default.
* Added method.CC_LS and method.CC_nloglik. These provide true convex combination optimization for the 2 loss functions. Contributed by Sam Lendle.
