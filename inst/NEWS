---
Version: 2.0-18
Date: 2014-04-25
* Added recombineSL and recombineCVSL functions to re-fit the ensemble using a new metalearner in a computationally efficient manner
* For all wrappers, converted to format package::function when calling functions from other namespaces
* Added S3 method declarations for all predict.SL.* functions
* Added a `SL.nnls` and `predict.SL.nnls` functions

---
Version: 2.0-17
Date: 2014-04-13
* Moved cvAUC to imports

---
Version: 2.0-16
Date: 2014-08-07
* Fixed error when computeCoef was re-run because of algorithms failing on full data
* Fixed Description field in Description file for CRAN policy

---
Version: 2.0-15
Date: 2014-07-16
* Fixed check for method.AUC and family
* Moved SL.bart over to SuperLearneExtra because BayesTree package no longer on CRAN

---
Version: 2.0-14
Date: 2014-07-14
* Added method.AUC, contributed by Erin LeDell

---
Version: 2.0-13
Date: 2014-04-16
* added the SampleSplitSuperLearner function to allow sample split validation instead of V-fold cross-validation

---
Version: 2.0-11
Date: 2013-12-31
* fixed package requirement in CV.SuperLearner from multicore to parallel
* Fixed a conflict with the reorder function in plot.CV.SuperLearner (between the stats and gdata namespace)
* Fixed a bug in SL.svm when family is binomial to grab the correct predicted probabilities (thanks to Jeremy Coyle)
* Added .Rbuildignore to not include the README.md file from GitHub on CRAN
* Removed SuperLearner.Rnw
* Moved vignettes to vignettes folder
* Changed cluster example to use PSOCK instead of MPI in SuperLearner.Rd
* removed the ":::" in plot.CV.SuperLearner
* moved quadprog from depends to suggests as it is only called if the user uses method = "method.NNLS2" not the default.
* Added method.CC_LS and method.CC_nloglik. These provide true convex combination optimization for the 2 loss functions. Contributed by Sam Lendle.

---
Version: 2.0-9
Date: 2012-09-10
* Updated help documents
* Added links to SuperLearnerExtra on Github

---
Version: 2.0-7
Date: 2012-04-04
* Switched from snow and multicore to parallel package
* fixed bug in CV.SuperLearner for leave-one-out cross-validation
* fixed bug in snowSuperLearner when only one screening algorithm is present
* method.NNloglik now reports the average -log likelihood instead of the sum to be consistent with NNLS

---
Version: 2.0-6
Date: 2012-02-29

* Added SL.leekasso (see http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/18132467723/prediction-the-lasso-vs-just-using-the-top-10 for details)
* fixed parallel argument in CV.SuperLearner. Now always a character variable, no longer accepts FALSE.
* fixed SL.gam to call gam::gam.control in case the mgcv package is also loaded after gam.

---
Version: 2.0-5
Date: 2011-10-12

* Fixed bug in CV.SuperLearner not saving SuperLearner objects (watch out for ifelse() statements).
* Added minbucket to SL.rpart.
* Added SL.rpartPrune, a version of SL.rpart with built-in pruning.

---
Version: 2.0-4
Date: 2011-10-01

* Minor changes to Rd files to cut build and check time. Time intensive examples now wrapped in \dontrun for CRAN.

---
Version: 2.0-3
Date: 2011-08-05

---
Version: 2.0-2

* fixed mcSuperLearner and snowSuperLearner not saving fitLibrary.
* added a placeholder Sweave vignette (SuperLearnerPresent.Rnw) to contain the SuperLearner presentation so the file can be found using the vignette() and browseVignettes() functions.
* CV.SuperLearner now outputs `LibraryNames`, `SL.library`, `method` and `Y`.
* summary.CV.SuperLearner has returned

---
Version: 2.0-1  
Date: 2011-05-17

---
Version: 2.0-0  
Date: 2010-12-27
