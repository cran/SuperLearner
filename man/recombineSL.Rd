\title{Recombine a SuperLearner fit using a new metalearning method}
\description{The \code{recombineSL} function takes an existing SuperLearner fit and a new metalearning method and returns a new SuperLearner fit with updated base learner weights.}

\usage{
recombineSL(object, Y, method = "method.NNloglik", verbose = FALSE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{object}{
Fitted object from \code{SuperLearner}.
}
  \item{Y}{ 
The outcome in the training data set. Must be a numeric vector.
}
  \item{method}{
A list (or a function to create a list) containing details on estimating the coefficients for the super learner and the model to combine the individual algorithms in the library. See \code{?method.template} for details.  Currently, the built in options are either "method.NNLS" (the default), "method.NNLS2", "method.NNloglik", "method.CC_LS", "method.CC_nloglik", or "method.AUC".  NNLS and NNLS2 are non-negative least squares based on the Lawson-Hanson algorithm and the dual method of Goldfarb and Idnani, respectively.  NNLS and NNLS2 will work for both gaussian and binomial outcomes.  NNloglik is a non-negative binomial likelihood maximization using the BFGS quasi-Newton optimization method. NN* methods are normalized so weights sum to one. CC_LS uses Goldfarb and Idnani's quadratic programming algorithm to calculate the best convex combination of weights to minimize the squared error loss. CC_nloglik calculates the convex combination of weights that minimize the negative binomial log likelihood on the logistic scale using the sequential quadratic programming algorithm.  AUC, which only works for binary outcomes, uses the Nelder-Mead method via the optim function to minimize rank loss (equivalent to maximizing AUC).
}
  \item{verbose}{
logical; TRUE for printing progress during the computation (helpful for debugging).
}
}

\details{
  \code{recombineSL} re-fits the super learner prediction algorithm using a new metalearning method.  The weights for each algorithm in \code{SL.library} are re-estimated using the new metalearner, however the base learner fits are not regenerated, so this function saves a lot of computation time as opposed to using the \code{SuperLearner} function with a new \code{method} argument.  The output is identical to the output from the \code{SuperLearner} function.

}
\value{
  \item{call}{
The matched call.
